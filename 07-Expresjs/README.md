# 🟧 Express.js Section

## 📚 Overview

This section covers **Express.js**, a minimalist and flexible Node.js framework for building **web applications and APIs**.
The content is organized to progress from basic Express concepts to building full-featured servers with routing, middleware, and testing.

It includes notes, practice snippets, and examples to help you understand how to structure and manage Node.js server applications efficiently.

---

## 🌐 What Is Express.js?

**Express.js** is a lightweight framework built on Node.js that simplifies server creation and routing.

💡 While Node.js provides the runtime environment, Express provides **tools, abstractions, and conventions** to build servers quickly and maintainably.
It handles routing, middleware, and HTTP utilities, making server-side JavaScript development faster and easier.

## 📘 Topics Covered

* Introduction to Express.js and its core concepts
* Setting up an Express server and understanding server structure
* HTTP basics: methods, status codes, and headers
* Express routing and route parameters
* Middleware: built-in, third-party, and custom functions
* Testing APIs with Postman
* Complete working examples combining all concepts

> 💡 Detailed explanations and summaries for each topic are in the `notes/` folder.

## 🧩 Learning Stages

### 1️⃣ Introduction to Express.js

* Why Express is used, framework philosophy, and key advantages over plain Node.js.

### 2️⃣ Setting Up an Express Server

* Installing dependencies, creating a basic server, and running it with Node.js.

### 3️⃣ HTTP Fundamentals

* Understanding HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), status codes, headers, and request/response objects.

### 4️⃣ Express Routing

* Creating routes, handling parameters, and organizing route files.

### 5️⃣ Middleware Deep Dive

* Using built-in middleware, creating custom middleware, order of execution, and practical use cases.

### 6️⃣ Testing with Postman

* Sending requests, testing endpoints, checking responses, and debugging APIs.

### 7️⃣ Complete Working Example

* Combining routing, middleware, and HTTP handling into a full server example.
