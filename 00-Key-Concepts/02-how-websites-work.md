# 🌐 How Do Websites Actually Work?  

## 📝 Introduction

- 🔌 The Internet connects clients (your device) with servers (websites).  
- 📖 DNS servers act like a phonebook to find the IP address of a site.  
- 🌍 Once you have the IP, your browser contacts the server and downloads files.  
- 📂 These files are usually **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  

## 🧱 HTML: The Content of a Website  

- 🧱 **HTML** = structure and content (text, images, links, buttons).  
- 🏠 **Analogy:** HTML is the **bricks** of a house.  
- **Example:** The Google logo, search box, and buttons come from HTML.  

## 🎨 CSS: Styling Your Website  

- 🎨 **CSS** = design, layout, and appearance.  
- 🏠 **Analogy:** CSS is the **paint and interior design** of the house.  
- **Example:** Button colors, fonts, and rounded corners come from CSS.  

## ⚡ JavaScript: Adding Functionality

- ⚡ **JavaScript** = interactivity and dynamic features.  
- 🏠 **Analogy:** JavaScript is the **electricity and appliances** in the house.  
- **Example:** Submitting a Google search, sending emails, posting on Instagram.  

## 🔎 **Example:** Google Homepage  

- 📂 Browser loads **HTML** → shows logo, search box, buttons.  
- 🎨 Browser loads **CSS** → applies design (shapes, colors).  
- ⚡ Browser loads **JavaScript** → enables search functionality.  
- Combined → A complete, interactive modern website.  

## 🛠 Inspecting Websites with Chrome DevTools  

- 🖱 Right-click on an element (e.g., “Google Search” button) → **Inspect**.  
- 🖥 Chrome DevTools shows the HTML code for that element.  
- ✏️ You can **edit the code locally** (e.g., rename button to "Angela Search").  
- 🔄 Refreshing resets changes → browser reloads fresh HTML, CSS, JS from the server.  
- 🎭 Fun trick: Edit visible text on sites like TechCrunch or BBC to prank friends.  

## 🚀 What’s Next?  

- Learn to code in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
- Create and host your own websites on the Internet.  
- Make them look how you want and work the way you need.  

## ✅ Key Takeaways  

- 🧱 **HTML** = content (the bricks).  
- 🎨 **CSS** = styling (the paint and design).  
- ⚡ **JavaScript** = functionality (electricity and appliances).  
- 🌍 Together they create interactive, modern websites.
