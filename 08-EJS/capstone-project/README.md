# 📝 Capstone Project 3: Blog Web Application

## 📌 Project Overview

This project consists of building a **Blog Web Application** using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **EJS**. The application allows users to create, view, edit, and delete blog posts through a clean and intuitive interface ✨.

The main focus of this project is learning **server-side rendering**, **routing**, and **templating**, while also paying close attention to **styling** and **responsiveness** 📱💻. Blog posts are stored in memory, meaning they **do not persist between sessions**, as no database is used in this version.
