## 🌐 What Is Bootstrap?

**Bootstrap** is a framework that provides **pre-built CSS and components** for web development.  

It helps developers:

- Quickly build responsive layouts  
- Use ready-made components like buttons, navbars, cards, and forms  
- Maintain consistency in design without writing all CSS from scratch  

💡 Bootstrap is mobile-first, meaning layouts adapt automatically to different screen sizes.

- Pre-styled UI components (buttons, forms, cards, navbars, etc.)  
- Utility classes for spacing, typography, colors, and display

> 💡 Detailed notes are available in the `notes/` folder.
