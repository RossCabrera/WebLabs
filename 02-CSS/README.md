## 🌐 What Is CSS?

**CSS** defines the **visual presentation** of websites — colors, fonts, spacing, layouts, and responsiveness.  

💡 While HTML provides structure, CSS makes web pages **look polished and user-friendly**.  
Browsers read your CSS rules and render your styles on top of HTML content.
