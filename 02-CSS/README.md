# 🎨 CSS Section

## 📚 Overview

This folder contains everything related to **learning and practicing CSS**, the language that styles and beautifies web content.

It's organized into **six stages** that build upon each other — from basic styling to advanced layout techniques like Flexbox and Grid.

---

## 🌐 What Is CSS?

**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** is the **language used to style HTML content**.

It defines the **visual presentation** of websites — colors, fonts, spacing, layouts, and responsiveness.

💡 While HTML provides structure, CSS makes web pages **look polished and user-friendly**.

Browsers like Chrome, Safari, or Brave read your CSS rules and render your styles on top of HTML content.

---

## 🏷️ How CSS Works

- CSS uses **selectors** to target HTML elements and **properties** to define styles.
- Styles are applied via **external stylesheets**, `<style>` tags in HTML, or inline styles.
- **Cascading**: rules flow from general → specific; conflicts are resolved by specificity and order.

```css
h1 {
  color: #2c3e50;
  font-size: 36px;
}

p {
  line-height: 1.5;
  color: #555;
}
```
