# 🟨 JavaScript Section

## 📚 Overview

This section covers **JavaScript**, the programming language that brings **interactivity, logic, and dynamic behavior** to web pages.
The content is organized into **five stages**, progressing from core language fundamentals to DOM manipulation and jQuery.

It includes notes and practice snippets focused on understanding how JavaScript works in the browser and how it interacts with HTML and CSS.

---

## 🌐 What Is JavaScript?

**JavaScript** is the language of the web used to control **behavior and interactivity** — handling user input, updating content dynamically, and responding to events.

💡 While HTML defines structure and CSS defines appearance, JavaScript defines **how the page behaves**.
Browsers execute JavaScript to manipulate the DOM, handle logic, and create dynamic user experiences.

## 📘 Topics Covered

* JavaScript syntax, variables, data types, and functions
* Control flow, loops, and arrays
* The Document Object Model (DOM)
* Selecting and manipulating HTML elements
* Event handling and user interactions
* Advanced concepts like callbacks, objects, and constructors
* jQuery for simplified DOM manipulation and animations

> 💡 Detailed explanations and summaries for each topic are in the `notes/` folder.

## 🧩 Learning Stages

### 1️⃣ Introduction to JavaScript

* JavaScript history, setup, basic syntax, variables, data types, strings, math operations, and functions.

### 2️⃣ Intermediate JavaScript

* Control flow with conditionals, loops, arrays, and randomness using `Math.random()`.

### 3️⃣ DOM & Events

* Understanding the DOM, linking scripts, selecting elements, modifying styles and content, and working with attributes.

### 4️⃣ Advanced JavaScript & DOM Manipulation

* Event listeners, callbacks, higher-order functions, objects, constructors, keyboard events, animations, and debugging.

### 5️⃣ jQuery

* Introduction to jQuery, comparing it with vanilla JavaScript, selectors, event handling, and animations.
