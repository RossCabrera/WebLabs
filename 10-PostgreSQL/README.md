# 🐘 PostgreSQL

This section covers everything from PostgreSQL fundamentals to advanced production-level database design and performance optimization.

You’ll move from basic CRUD operations to indexing strategies, full-text search, performance tuning, and real-world backend integration with Node.js and Django.

## 📚 What is PostgreSQL?

PostgreSQL is an advanced open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). It is known for:

- ACID compliance  
- Strong data integrity  
- Powerful indexing  
- JSON/JSONB support  
- Advanced querying capabilities  
- Extensibility and performance  

It is widely used in production systems ranging from startups to enterprise-scale applications.
