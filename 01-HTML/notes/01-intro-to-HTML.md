## 📝 Notes  

### 🏷️ Heading Elements  

- Defined using tags `<h1>` through `<h6>`, representing different **content hierarchy levels**.  
- `<h1>` is the most important heading, while `<h6>` is the least.  
- Always use **one `<h1>` per page** for accessibility and semantic clarity.  
- Avoid skipping heading levels (e.g., from `<h1>` to `<h4>`).  
- Learn more on [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements).

### 📄 Paragraph Element  

- The `<p>` tag structures text into **separate paragraphs**.  
- Without `<p>`, all text appears in one block — hard to read.  
- Screen readers use `<p>` tags to help users navigate content.  
- Common placeholder text for design:  
  - [**Lorem Ipsum**](https://www.lipsum.com/)  
  - [**Bro Ipsum**](https://www.broipsum.com/) (fun variant for developers)

### ⚙️ Void Elements  

- **Void elements** are self-closing tags that don’t contain content.  
  Examples: `<br />` (line break) and `<hr />` (horizontal line).  
- Syntax difference: includes a `/` before the closing `>`.  
- Use `<br />` for line breaks within text.  
- Use `<hr />` to separate sections of content visually.  
- Proper use improves both **readability** and **accessibility**.

## 🔑 Summary  

- HTML structures and organizes web content using elements.  
- Headings define hierarchy, paragraphs separate blocks of text, and void elements add structure without content.
- Understanding these basics creates the foundation for building well-structured, accessible web pages.
