<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I’m a passionate learner and aspiring full-stack developer who loves turning ideas into functional, beautiful web experiences. I enjoy both the creative side of design and the logical challenge of coding. My goal is to build projects that not only look great but also solve real problems for people.</p>

<p>I’m currently focused on strengthening my skills in Python, Django, JavaScript, and React, while exploring topics like data science, AI, and cloud technologies. I believe in learning by doing—experimenting, breaking things, and rebuilding them better each time.</p>

<p>Outside of coding, I enjoy reading, writing, and exploring ways to grow personally and professionally. I’m motivated by curiosity, creativity, and the desire to keep improving a little every day.</p>
