# 🧱 HTML Section  

## 📚 Overview

This folder contains everything related to **learning and practicing HTML**, the language that gives structure and meaning to web content.  
It’s organized into **three stages** that build upon each other — from basic syntax to multi-page websites.  

---

## 🌐 What Is HTML?

**HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)** is the **foundation of every web page**.  
It defines the **structure and content** of websites — everything from headings and paragraphs to links and images.  

💡 You can create a complete webpage using **only HTML**.  
Browsers like Chrome, Safari, or Brave read your HTML code and render it visually, often combined with CSS and JavaScript.

---

## 🔗 Hypertext  

- **Hypertext** = text that links to other pages or files (**hyperlinks**).  
- Hyperlinks are how websites **connect multiple pages**.  
- Example: Clicking a link on `index.html` might open `about.html`.  
- This concept comes from the **first websites**, all built with plain HTML and hyperlinks.  

---

## 🏷️ Markup Language

HTML is a **markup language**, meaning it uses **tags** to tell browsers how to display content.  
Each tag has an **opening** and **closing** form:  

```html
<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<a href="page.html">Go to page</a>
```

## 📚 Learning Stages

### 1️⃣ Introduction to HTML

- Learn the foundations — what HTML is, essential elements like headings, paragraphs, and void elements.

### 2️⃣ Intermediate HTML

- Explore lists, nesting, indentation, anchor tags, and images.
- Focuses on structuring and linking content effectively.

### 3️⃣ Multi-Page Websites

- Combine all previous knowledge to create multi-page sites, understand file paths, and use a basic HTML boilerplate.
- Includes practice on hosting and portfolio setup.

### 🧠 practice-snippets/

- Small, focused HTML exercises.
- ***Each folder includes:***

  - `index.html` — practice code
  - `goal.png` — visual reference of expected result

### 🎨 projects/

- Mini-projects that combine multiple topics.
- ***Each subfolder contains:***

  - `index.html` — your implementation
  - `solution.html` — reference solution (if available)
