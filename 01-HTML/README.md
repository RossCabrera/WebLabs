# 📦 HTML Section

## 📚 Overview

## 🌐 What Is HTML?

**HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)** is the **foundation of every web page**.  
It defines the **structure and content** of websites — everything from headings and paragraphs to links and images.  

💡 You can create a complete webpage using **only HTML**.  
Browsers like Chrome, Safari, or Brave read your HTML code and render it visually.
